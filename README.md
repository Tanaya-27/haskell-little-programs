# Haskell Programs
A small collection of tasks to build my competency in haskell; these are loosely based on demonstrations from Graham Hutton's book "Programming in Haskell":

## firstScript.hs
This basic project offers essential numerical operations, including functions to calculate double and quadruple values, identify smallest and largest numbers between inputs, and compute the difference between the largest and smallest values.
## functions.hs

## typesAndClasses.hs

## stringCompression.hs
