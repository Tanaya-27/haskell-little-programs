# Haskell Programs
A small collection of tasks to build my competency in haskell; these are loosely based on demonstrations from Graham Hutton's book "Programming in Haskell":

## firstScript.hs
This basic project offers essential numerical operations, including functions to calculate double and quadruple values, identify smallest and largest numbers between inputs, and compute the difference between the largest and smallest values.

## typesAndClasses.hs

## functions.hs
This project includes multiple methods: 
- three functions to extract the second element from a list ```second1```, ```second2```, and ```second3```;
- three exclusive OR operations for boolean inputs ```xor1```, ```xor2```, and ```xor3```;
- mathematical calculations: sum of squares ```sumsqr```, grid coordinate generation ```grid```, and the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor ```euclid```;
- and an efficient list reversal function ```fastrev``` by utilising an auxiliary recursive function ```rev```.

## stringCompression.hs
